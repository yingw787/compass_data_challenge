"""Part 1 of the Compass data engineering challenge.

Problem: The Data Engineering team is trying to help the Pokemon services team
with creating an analytics database that they can answer some metrics
questions with. Pokemon services has a publicly available API located at
https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2.html/ that we will use to pull data from. Weâ€™ve
been tasked with designing a schema with tables that contain information to
answer the following questions about the first 15 Pokemon in their API.

Part 1: Using the API docs provided, design the tables with the columns you
will need to create in order to serve queries about the questions above. List
out all of the table names and columns in a text file to be submitted with the
homework. Additionally, create a SQLite database and create the schema/tables
that you designed in that database.
